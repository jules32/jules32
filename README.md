Hello! I'm a marine ecologist and founded Openscapes to champion kinder, better science in less time. I'm interested in how open source, data science, and environmental research can help us uncover environmental solutions faster by working together as teams and communities. I love to learn and share and am so grateful for all the amazing people working in these spaces.


### What am I up to? 

Openscapes focuses on open data science mentorship for research teams. Currently we're focusing on learner-oriented tutorials and documentation to teach research teams and onboard mentor teams. 

- ðŸŒ„ The [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide) is our attempt to codify our approach with Openscapes so that others can use this approach with us or on their own. 
- ðŸš€ The [NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook) is a collaboration with our NASA-Openscapes mentor teams to help support NASA Earth science research teamsâ€™ migration to the cloud.
